# Eyd0t

Eyd0t is a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) E-Commerce website that is dedicated exclusively to retail for footwear. 

From the various goods available, we choose to specialize in footwear since we feel that footwear is the cornerstone of a flawless outfit. It not only satisfies one's desire for fashion, but also reflects one's individuality and style. The website will serve as a one-stop platform for footwear from leading international and local footwear merchants. For instance, Adidas from Germany, Nike from the United States, Charles and Keith from Singapore, Pedro from Singapore.
 
The economy of Singapore will benefit from our website. Shoe-lovers will be drawn to the website by well-known international merchants. The website will promote and display products from local merchants, allowing people to see how much ingenuity exists in our community and support them.
 
This website will be handy because there is no other website in Singapore that is similar to ours. There are two types of shoe-selling websites in Singapore. The first are branded websites such as Puma, Charles, and Keith. Second, selling shoes from different brands is simply a feature of websites like Amazon, Shopee, Ezbuy, Zalora, and others. Due to our personalised footwear website, our website will stand out among the various merchants as it is an exclusive footwear website from a variety of merchants.
